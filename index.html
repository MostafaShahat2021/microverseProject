    <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
      <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era
          program known as the "National Youth Administration" </li>
      <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
          starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me." </li>
      <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service </li>
      <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin
          Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
          pest-resistent plants. </li>
      <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the
          military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
          applied science. </li>
      <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology </li>
      <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to
          Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
          different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate
          on Earth. </li>
    </ul>
